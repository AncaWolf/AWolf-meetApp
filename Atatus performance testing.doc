    Project launched on Atatus
    Awaiting traffic (reached out on Slack)

    Currently there are no changes (not even my own visit on the website is registered, all scores are at 0%)
    The error specified in the Exercise has not occured



Task Questions:

  Performance test related:

    1. Did you notice a difference in loading or response times for different browsers and OSs?

    2. What are some, if any, of the errors you're detecting and why?

  Lesson related:

    1. What are CI and CD, and why are they both important?
      CI or Continuous Integration, is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, where it will be automatically tested so errors can be detected after each change. It helps with keeping a functioning software throughout the development process.

      CD or Continuous Delivery, is basically an extension of CI, ensuring that software changes that do not present errors(which CI would flag and report to the developers team) are deployed to production environments automatically and quickly.
      

    2. What are the advantages of using CI and CD tools during the development process?
      Both CI and CD are important because of the several benefits they add to the development process. Reasons like:
        Reduced Risk - CI helps identify issues and address them early.
        Faster Feedback Loop - CI and CD enable developers to receive feedback on their code changes quickly.
        Increased Agility - with CI and CD pipelines in place, teams can release new features, fixes and updates more frequently, allowing them to respond to customer needs and market demands more effectively.
        Improved Collaboration - CI encouranges collaboration among developers.
        Consistend and Reliable Deployments - CD automates the deployment process, reducing the possibility of error, and ensuring that deployments are consistent across different environments.
        Efficiency and Cost Reduction - when repetitve tasks are automated, it saves time and resources, ultimately leading to increased efficiency and cost reduction.


    3. How could you use CI and CD practices during your Meet app's development?
      Using GitHub repositories allows me to track all changes to the project, and share it with fellow developer students, tutor and mentor, for the purpose of improving and debugging issues I may have less knowledge about.
